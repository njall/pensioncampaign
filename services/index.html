<h4>Massage Therapies for Athletes</h4>

It has been proven in history that massage therapies assist athletes in competing and continuing with sporting activities, from Hippocrates' own advice to bathe and have a massage every day, through to more specific guidance regarding athletes receiving rub downs to help prepare for future events.

Massage therapies can help to energise an athlete towards an event; assist in the maintainable of performance during an event, and more familiarly provide relief and relaxation post-event. To help plan your treatments, contact Holly Warne Sports Massage.

<h4>General Massage Therapies</h4>

Massage can be stimulating or relaxing, depending on what is required. A stimulating massage will invigorate the recipient, preparing their muscles for activity, and can assist in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body.  A relaxing massage can help unwind and allow your muscles to melt away any tension, resetting them and allowing your mind to clear.  You can book either of these therapies through Holly Warne Sports Massage.
