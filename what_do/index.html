title: What Can I do

<ol>
<p>
<li>Let us get one thing straight from the beginning; if you do nothing and expect the
Government or the Pension Protection Fund to restore your pension to its proper value with
full inflation protection <b>IT WILL NOT HAPPEN!</b></li>
</p>
<p>
<li>A small group of us have been battling this for nearly six years. The greater the number of
AEA Technology plc pensioners who get involved in protesting and bombard/pester/contact
their MP, Government Departments etc. the better, <b>QUANTITY DOES MATTER.</b></li>
</p>
<p>
<li><p>Write to your constituency MP. If you don’t get an answer within a fortnight write and
email again.</p>
<p>Ask to meet your MP face to face at their surgery.</p>
<p>The message is simple. When you were transferred to AEA Technology plc from UKAEA in
1996 you were repeatedly assured in writing by the Government that your pension was safe
with the new company and that you could safely transfer your accruals to the new scheme.
When your new employer arranged to go into pre-pack administration, the Government
RENEGED on its commitment to protect your pension. If it can do this to you it can do it to
anybody whatever the circumstances.</p>
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><p>Write to the Minister at the BEIS (The Business Department) sending the letter through
your MP. BEIS is the Government Department that has taken over the responsibilities of the
DTI who were involved in the original privatisation in 1996. State that you were repeatedly
assured in 1996 of the safety and equivalence of the new pension- in Parliament and by the
Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) in a note given to <b>EVEYONE</b> transferring to the new private company. If BEIS don’t reply within three weeks keep bombarding them, keep
your MP involved.</p>
<p>If the BEIS fob you off with a so called Factsheet, issued in June 2013, point out the half
truths and inaccuracies in this. If they then produce a note from GAD dated September 1996
and a DTI memo dated February 1997, both of which throw doubt on the safety and stability
of the new pension scheme, point out that you knew <b>NOTHING</b> of these documents until
now – i.e. nearly 20 years after you had to make your decision on pensions. Ask why these
documents were hidden from you. This is deliberate deception.</p>
<p>
If the BEIS say there have been two Parliamentary debates on the matter point out that in both
cases the Government Minister’s reply was flawed – in the first case the Minister said he
could not intervene because ‘it would open the flood gates to BT.’ However BT’s pension
fund has a Government guarantee! In the second case the Minister said GAD give information
not advice. However in their Mission Statement GAD say they do give advice!
Yes, this will annoy both Ministers and MPs – good, the more annoyed they get the better.
There are other things you can do; ask us for full details.
